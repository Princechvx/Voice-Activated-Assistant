Voice-Activated Personal Assistant (Jarvis)



Overview--
Jarvis is a Python-based voice-activated personal assistant that listens for user commands and performs a variety of tasks, such as opening websites, fetching news, and playing music. The assistant can process both voice and keyboard inputs, providing a hands-free interaction experience.





Features-- 
Voice Command Recognition: Use your voice to interact with Jarvis and give commands.
Text-to-Speech Responses: Jarvis responds verbally using Google Text-to-Speech.
Web Interaction: Jarvis can open websites like Google, YouTube, LinkedIn, and more.
Music Playback: Request songs, and Jarvis will play them from your music library.
News Fetching: Get the latest news headlines using the NewsAPI.
Dual Input Modes: Supports both voice and keyboard input for flexibility.





Requirements-- 
To run this project, you need the following dependencies:
Python 3.x
speech_recognition library
pyttsx3 library
gTTS library
requests library
pygame library
You can install the required libraries by running:
pip install -r requirements.txt



How to Run --
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your_username/Voice-Activated-Assistant.git
cd Voice-Activated-Assistant



Install dependencies: Ensure that you have installed all the required Python libraries:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the application: Execute the Python script to start the assistant:
python assistant.py




Usage--
Voice Activation:
Jarvis listens for the wake word "Jarvis". After hearing the wake word, Jarvis will ask for your command, and you can give commands like:
"Open Google"
"Play [song name]"
"Get news"
Keyboard Input:
Alternatively, you can type your command directly into the terminal.



Project Structure--
assistant.py: The main Python script containing the code for Jarvis.
musicLibrary.py: A module that stores a dictionary of songs and their corresponding URLs.



Future Enhancements--
Add support for more languages.
Integrate machine learning models for better speech recognition.
Expand functionalities to include smart home device control.
